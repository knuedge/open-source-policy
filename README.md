### KnuEdge Team Guidance

For KnuEdge team members, we have guidance on how KnuEdge puts this policy into practice, and how we handle the narrow situations where we may delay or withhold the release of source code.

### Credits

This policy was originally forked from and heavily inspired by [18F's policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy) which in turn was forked from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's policy](https://github.com/cfpb/source-code-policy). We at KnuEdge are grateful that such organizations exist and demonstrate the ideals of open source development and culture.
